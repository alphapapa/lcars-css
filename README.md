# lcars-css
LCARS-like UI styling.

LCARS Â© CBS Studios Inc.

## Project outline
A simple CSS Library based on the Star-Trek LCARS Design principles. These have been modified to make more efficient use of space. There's a balance to be struck between cool sci-fi styling and helpful UI. This is an attempt at that balance. It is also, of course, a work-in-progress.

## Recommendations for use
Works best when used over a framework such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com).

## Requirements
Uses the following:
* jQuery
* FontAwesome

## Getting Started
Examples for use are in the `index.html` file. As in that file, link up the JS and CSS necessary in your `<head>`:

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/lcars.min.css"/>
    <script src="js/lcars.js"></script>


## Extending/Modifying
The styles are written in Sass, so go nuts modifying the defaults if you like.

Also, I'm open to any and all pull requests to improve this project.
